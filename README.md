This code is an implementation of the self-organizing map (SOMs) form scrach using Python.
The SOMs algorithm aims to cluster words belonging to four categories: animals, countries, fruits, and veggies. The algorithm is trained on the word embeddings taken from the pre-trained Global Vectors (GloVe). 

#How to run the code to produce the results..

## Installation

install the dependencies using pip:
`pip install python3`
`pip install matplotlib`
`pip install numpy`

## Run the code by running the following command:

   `python SOM.py`
   
    This assumes that the filename of the code is `SOM.py`. If the filename is different, replace `SOM.py` with the actual filename.
    The code will load the data files, fit the Self-Organizing Map (SOM) model, print the results, and plot the scores for different values of k. 
    The plots will be displayed on the screen.

    Note: Make sure that the data files are located in the same directory as the code file. 
        If the data files are located in a different directory, modify the paths in the code accordingly.

## usage 
To train the Word Clustering using SOMs on dataset .
